### Project Description
BrowBer is a playful web app that acts as a fun, slightly useless decision-making aid for your eyebrows. Simply upload your photo to try on different trendy brow shapes as adjustable overlays. For a final, ridiculous touch, click the button to get a randomized count of how many hairs you'll need to pluck for your new look.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Problem of not knowing how many hairs to be plucked for each styles

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Upload an image and align your eyebrow to the layouts
